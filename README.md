Speedial-Phoenix is the name of a game that does not yet exist, ideas float around however the purpose of this project is largely to learn how to use Godot. Before the end of this summer, May 2025 - August 2025, I want to have completed building 3 levels that can be navigated between within the game, graphics and animations and sound does not matter, this is purely to learn and see if a game in the style of games like "Hotline Miami" are fun and able to be pursued. Completely open source, feel free to fork and work on what I have offered, and enjoy.

Major Update:
Major updates added, these are mainly for me to keep track of the project and remain motivated. The plan of 3 levels had left my mine but is now once again the goal. I have completed large portions of the absolutely necessary gameplay features, and the immediate ideas on my mind are enemy types (aka they hold different weapons) that drop their weapons on death. Following that I will likely implement a UI for starting and level select, unless something else pops into my mind after completing the enemy changes. As for the enemy overhaul, the pathfinding was completed much earlier than I thought it would, which inadverdantly made me comfortable enough to drop the project leading to the hiatus. Now that I have realised how incredibly rudimentary it was, I am more willing to learn further to reach whatever it is that I think is "real-game development". Major updates follow no schedule, and are less about the game and more for a game dev journal talking about the state of the game and it's developer. Stay tuned.
